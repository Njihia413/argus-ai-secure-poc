# Progress Tracking: Argus AI Secure

## Implemented Features

### Authentication
- [x] Login page implementation
- [x] Signup page implementation
- [x] WebAuthn integration
- [x] Authentication flows
- [x] Backend account locking logic simplified (manual admin unlock, locks at 5 attempts, `failed_login_attempts` persist through unlock and increment even if account is already locked, `unlocked_by` stores admin username, migration script corrected)

### Dashboard
- [x] Main dashboard layout
- [x] Sidebar navigation
- [x] Security overview page
- [x] Locked accounts view (**UI refined: single search filter with increased width (`max-w-md`), styling aligned with other tables, sonner toasts for notifications, "Action" column header, standardized button style, "Unlock Account" button now has a confirmation dialog styled with `font-montserrat`, "Successful Attempts" column removed**)
- [x] Users management (**Enhanced with client-side search and dropdown filters for role & security key status. Filters are part of the `DataTable` via a `toolbar` prop. Filter controls use `font-montserrat`. Security key filter labels updated.**)
- [x] Audit logs view
- [x] Settings page

### Security Features
- [x] Security key management
- [x] Locked accounts monitoring (**Improved data table UI: single search with `max-w-md`, "Action" column, standardized button style, unlock confirmation modal with consistent styling, "Successful Attempts" column removed**)
- [x] Audit logging system
- [x] User activity tracking

### AI Integration
- [x] AI chat implementation
- [x] AI providers setup
- [x] AI tools integration

## In Progress
1.  Security Dashboard Enhancements
    *   Data visualization improvements
    *   Real-time updates
    *   Enhanced filtering (User table now has specific filters. Review if other tables need similar specific filters or if global search is sufficient).
    *   [x] Generic `DataTable` component now supports a `toolbar` prop for custom filter controls.
    *   [x] Generic `DataTable` component now includes pagination.

2.  Locked Accounts Management
    *   Bulk actions implementation
    *   Review recovery workflow based on manual admin unlock with confirmation.

3.  AI Features
    *   Enhanced security insights
    *   Automated threat detection
    *   Security recommendations

## Known Issues
1.  Performance
    *   Large data table optimization needed
    *   Initial load time optimization

2.  Security
    *   Rate limiting implementation needed
    *   Additional security headers

3.  UX Improvements
    *   Mobile responsiveness refinements
    *   Loading state improvements (standardized spinner, loading state for dialog buttons)
    *   Error handling enhancements (standardized sonner toasts)
    *   Ensure consistent search/filter patterns and input sizing across all data tables (User table filters implemented via `toolbar` prop).
    *   Ensure consistent use of confirmation dialogs (styling and behavior) for critical actions across the application.
    *   Review all data tables for column relevance.

## Next Steps
1.  Short Term
    *   Optimize data table performance
    *   Enhance mobile responsiveness
    *   Implement rate limiting
    *   Review and standardize search/filter UX and input sizing across all data tables (User table is a good example with `toolbar` prop).
    *   [x] Add pagination to all relevant data tables (Generic `DataTable` now has pagination).
    *   Review other critical actions for potential confirmation dialogs and consistent styling.
    *   Review column selection in all data tables for relevance.

2.  Medium Term
    *   Add advanced security analytics
    *   Enhance AI security features
    *   Implement bulk operations for locked accounts

3.  Long Term
    *   Advanced threat detection
    *   Machine learning integration
    *   Automated security response
