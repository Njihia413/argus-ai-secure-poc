## In Progress
1.  Security Dashboard Enhancements
    *   Data visualization improvements
    *   Real-time updates
    *   Enhanced filtering (review if single global search is sufficient or if column-specific filters are still needed elsewhere)

2.  Locked Accounts Management
    *   Bulk actions implementation
    *   Review recovery workflow based on manual admin unlock with confirmation.

3.  AI Features
    *   Enhanced security insights
    *   Automated threat detection
    *   Security recommendations

## Known Issues
1.  Performance
    *   Large data table optimization needed
    *   Initial load time optimization

2.  Security
    *   Rate limiting implementation needed
    *   Additional security headers

3.  UX Improvements
    *   Mobile responsiveness refinements
    *   Loading state improvements (standardized spinner, loading state for dialog buttons)
    *   Error handling enhancements (standardized sonner toasts)
    *   Ensure consistent search/filter patterns and input sizing across all data tables.
    *   Ensure consistent use of confirmation dialogs (styling and behavior) for critical actions across the application.
    *   Review all data tables for column relevance.

## Next Steps
1.  Short Term
    *   Optimize data table performance
    *   Enhance mobile responsiveness
    *   Implement rate limiting
    *   Review and standardize search/filter UX and input sizing across all data tables.
    *   Review other critical actions for potential confirmation dialogs and consistent styling.
    *   Review column selection in all data tables for relevance.

2.  Medium Term
    *   Add advanced security analytics
    *   Enhance AI security features
    *   Implement bulk operations for locked accounts

3.  Long Term
    *   Advanced threat detection
    *   Machine learning integration
    *   Automated security response
