# Product Context: Argus AI Secure POC

## 1. The Problem We're Solving

In many organizations, access to powerful AI tools is becoming widespread. However, controlling access to the most advanced or sensitive AI models is a growing security concern. Standard username/password authentication is often not enough to prevent unauthorized access, especially when dealing with models that might process confidential data or perform critical tasks.

There is a need for a higher level of assurance that the person accessing a powerful AI model is who they say they are, and that they are doing so from a trusted environment.

## 2. How Argus AI Solves It

Argus AI introduces a "something you have" factor into the authentication process by requiring a physical hardware security key. This concept, often called "step-up authentication," provides a practical and secure way to manage access to high-privilege resources.

The core product idea is:
-   **Baseline Access:** All authenticated users can access standard AI models.
-   **Elevated Access:** To access premium, more powerful, or specialized AI models, a user must have their company-issued, registered security key physically plugged into their computer.

This approach ensures that even if a user's credentials are compromised, an attacker cannot gain access to the most sensitive AI capabilities without also having physical possession of the user's security key.

## 3. User Experience Goals

-   **Seamless Elevation:** The process of gaining access to advanced models should be as simple as plugging in the security key. The UI should update automatically without requiring the user to re-authenticate or refresh the page.
-   **Clear Feedback:** The user should always have clear, immediate feedback about their current access level.
    -   When a key is connected, a success notification should appear, and the list of available models should expand.
    -   When a key is disconnected, a notification should inform the user, and the model list should revert to the restricted set.
-   **Security Transparency:** Users, and especially administrators, should have a clear view of security-related events, including login attempts, key usage, and access changes.
-   **Error Handling:** If an incorrect (unregistered or belonging to another user) security key is plugged in, the user should receive a clear error message explaining why access is not being granted. This prevents confusion and reinforces the security model.
