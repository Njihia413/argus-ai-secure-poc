# Active Context: Argus AI Secure

## Current Focus
Based on open files and recent activity, development is focused on security management features:

1.  Security Dashboard Implementation
    *   Security key management interface
    *   Dashboard security overview
    *   Integration with WebAuthn

2.  Locked Accounts Management
    *   Data table implementation for locked accounts (**Updated styling and functionality**)
    *   Account status monitoring
    *   Account recovery workflows (**Simplified backend logic for account lock, frontend notifications use sonner toasts**)

3.  Active Components
    *   `locked-accounts-data-table.tsx`: Main interface for locked accounts (**Refined styling, filtering, and notification handling**)
    *   `locked-accounts-columns.tsx`: Data structure for locked accounts (**Updated to match API response, uses sonner toasts for actions**)
    *   `security/page.tsx`: Security dashboard implementation
    *   `app-sidebar.tsx`: Navigation and layout structure
    *   `../backend/app.py`: Backend logic for authentication and account management (**Simplified account lock mechanism, removed time-based auto-unlock**)

## Recent Decisions
1.  Using data tables for security information display.
2.  Implementing WebAuthn for authentication.
3.  Structured routing for security features.
4.  Standardized on `sonner` for toast notifications across frontend components.
5.  Simplified account locking in the backend to require manual admin unlock.

## Active Technical Patterns
1.  Data Table Pattern
    *   Reusable table structure with `Card` and `CardContent` wrappers for consistent styling.
    *   Customizable columns with sorting and filtering.
    *   Consistent data display and action handling.

2.  Security Patterns
    *   WebAuthn integration.
    *   Locked account management (manual unlock by admin).
    *   Audit logging.

3.  Layout Patterns
    *   Dashboard layout with sidebar.
    *   Security-focused navigation.
    *   Responsive design implementation.

4.  Notification Pattern
    *   Using `sonner` for consistent toast notifications for user feedback (e.g., account unlock success/failure).

## Current Considerations
1.  Security Features
    *   Account locking mechanisms (currently manual admin unlock).
    *   Security key management.
    *   Audit trail implementation.

2.  User Experience
    *   Dashboard information hierarchy.
    *   Security status visibility.
    *   Account recovery flows (admin-initiated unlock).
    *   Consistent notification patterns.

3.  Integration Points
    *   Backend API integration for account management.
    *   AI assistance features.
    *   Authentication flows.
